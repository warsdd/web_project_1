              <p class="two-columns__paragraph">Whether it's at school or university, the one thing no one ever
                teaches you is how to teach yourself. We often just end up drilling specific exercises and mindlessly
                memorizing information so that when exam time comes around, we pass the test. But once the test is over,
                that information has outlived its usefulness, and there's no guarantee that information will be
                retained. In the end, we're really just learning how to pass our tests.</p>
              <p class="two-columns__paragraph"><span class="two-columns__span-accent">Here's the real question:
                </span>does
                this approach of repetition and memorization help us truly understand the subject material? The academic
                consensus nowadays is that it doesn't. In fact,
                what's more important than any individual topic is knowing how to study, but for some reason,
                this point is often overlooked. So, what can we do to remedy this?</p>
              <p class="two-columns__paragraph">Well, there are various techniques and exercises that can be applied
                to the educational process to help make it more efficient and engaging. Keep scrolling to uncover some
                of
                the secrets of effective learning.</p>

          <div class="two-columns__main-text">
            <p class="two-columns__paragraph">Math didn't come naturally to Barbara in childhood. She thought of
              herself
              as more of a humanities person, and not a brilliant one at that. With an eye to becoming a linguist,
              after
              school she enlisted in the army, who sent her to learn Russian. After several years of service, during
              which she rose to the rank of Captain, Barbara left the army and decided to study engineering. It was
              during this time that she developed her learning methodology as she was forced to reprogram her brain
              for
              a different kind of learning. It turns out that when something doesn't come naturally to you, having to
              work hard to gain knowledge that other people may get at first glance gives you a deeper, more
              comprehensive understanding of the subject matter.</p>
